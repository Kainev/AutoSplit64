<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img align="left" width="75" src="https://i.imgur.com/mDpN3EN.png" alt="AutoSplit64 Screenshot" />

AutoSplit64 (AS64) is a tool for analyzing the game feed of Super Mario 64, detecting key game state information in real-time.

AS64 is primarily designed to automate LiveSplit during speedruns, however it also features an extensible plugin system, enabling the creation of custom plugins that make use of real-time data to enhance the speedrunning experience.

AS64 uses a combination of Python and C++ for game state analysis, with an exposed Python API for plugin development. In fact, most of the core functionality is provided via pre-packaged plugins!

The front-end is built with React, Electron, and Vite, with a similarily exposed API for creating custom interfaces for plugin interaction.
